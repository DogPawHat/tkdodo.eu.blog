React Query version 5 was released about three months ago, and with it, we got one of the biggest "breaking" changes in the library's history. All of our functions now only get one object passed, instead of multiple arguments. We call this object the <Emph>Query Options</Emph>, because it contains all the options you need to create a query:

```diff
- useQuery(
-   ['todos'],
-   fetchTodos,
-   { staleTime: 5000 }
- )
+ useQuery({
+   queryKey: ['todos'],
+   queryFn: fetchTodos,
+   staleTime: 5000
+ })
```

This isn't only true for `useQuery` calls, but also for imperative actions like invalidating a query:

```diff
- queryClient.invalidateQueries(['todos'])
+ queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['todos'] })
```

Now technically, this API isn't new. Most of our functions had overloads, so even in v3, you could already pass an object instead of multiple arguments. It's just that it wasn't really advocated for. All examples, the docs and many blog posts (including this one) used the old API, which is why this was a breaking change for most apps.

So why did we do it?

## A better abstraction

First of all, having all those overloads is a chore for maintainers, and it's also not clear for users. Why can I call the same function in multiple ways - is one better than the other? So, streamlining the API, thus making it easier for new starters to understand it, was one goal. "Always pass one object" is as simple and extensible as it gets.

But also, it turns out that one object to rule them all is simply a very good abstraction for when you want to share query options between different functions. I discovered this "by accident" when I wrote the [React Query meets React Router](react-query-meets-react-router) article, where want to share query options between prefetching and our `useQuery` call. Now usually, you could just write custom hooks as your primary way to re-use queries. But that doesn't work when imperative function calls like `prefetching` are involved. So I came up with something, and [Alex](https://bsky.app/profile/ralexanderson‚Äç.com) noted this as a good pattern:

Turns out, if all your functions have the same interface - accepting a single object - it makes a lot of sense to abstract that object away into a query definition. Once you have that, you can pass it everywhere:

```js:title=todos-query
const todosQuery = {
  queryKey: ['todos'],
  queryFn: fetchTodos,
  staleTime: 5000,
}

// ‚úÖ works
useQuery(todosQuery)

// ü§ù sure
queryClient.prefetchQuery(todosQuery)

// üôå oh yeah
useSuspenseQuery(todosQuery)

// üéâ absolutely
useQueries([{
  queries: [todosQuery]
}]
```

In hindsight, this pattern just feels beautiful as the main abstraction for queries, and I wanted to apply it everywhere. There was just one problem:

## TypeScript

The way TypeScript handles excess properties is quite special. If you inline them, TypeScript will be like: Why are you doing this - it doesn't make any sense, I'll error out:

```ts:title=inlined-objects
useQuery({
  queryKey: ['todos'],
  queryFn: fetchTodos,
  stallTime: 5000,
})
```

[TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBAbzgVwM4FMCKz1QJ5wC+cAZlBCHAOQACMAhgHaoMDGA1gPRTr2swBaAI458VAFDiYeMOjgAVCABMIcALyJxcbXGBKAXHEbIQAI1zjC4pelYAbej1LJG-YBEal0MVgAtFKqgAFACUhgAK5CDAGAA8AIJQUPR4sQEQAHwZkmhYonhBCFpwIrh4ANLoeIYA2lQwyhCoVAC6ADTFpfgAYoyGJN5+6agd2iz0dnbyoOiGAKwADEsdhCFAA)

<Alert sx={{ fontFamily: 'ml, monospace', fontSize: [0, 1] }}>

  does not exist in type 'UseQueryOptions&lt;Todo[], Error, Todo[],
  string[]&gt;'. Did you mean to write 'staleTime'?(2769)
</Alert>

Which is cool, because it catches typos like the one above. But what if you abstract the whole object away into a constant, like our pattern suggests?

```ts:title=no-error
const todosQuery = {
  queryKey: ['todos'],
  queryFn: fetchTodos,
  stallTime: 5000,
}

useQuery(todosQuery)
```

[TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBAbzgVwM4FMCKz1QJ5wC+cAZlBCHAOQACMAhgHaoMDGA1gPRTr2swBaAI458VAFDiYeMOjgAVCABMIcALyJxcbXGBKAXHEbIQAI1zjC4pelYAbej1LJG-YBEal0MVgAtFKqgAFACUhgAK5CDAGAA8AIJQUPR4sQEQAHwZkqweLHAwyhCo2LgEGghacCJlANLoeIYA2lSFgVQAugA0VTX4AGKMhiTefumoPdos9HZ28qDohgCsAAxrPVbiaFiieEFtxaX4IUA)

No error. üôà

TypeScript is quite relaxed in these situations, because at runtime, the "extra" property `stallTime` doesn't hurt, and you might want to use that object in a context where the property is required. TypeScript can't know that. And since `staleTime` is optional, we are now just _not_ passing it. Of course, this is "valid", but it's not what we'd expect, and it can be a costly mistake to find.

## queryOptions

That's why we've introduced a type-safe helper function in v5 called `queryOptions`. At runtime, it doesn't do anything:

```js:title=queryOptions
export function queryOptions(options) {
  return options
}
```

But on type level, it's a real powerhouse that not only fixes the above typo issue (see the [fixed playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBAbzgVwM4FMCKz1QJ4A0cAjjvgPJgzAQB2qcAvnAGZQQhwDkAAjAIb0BAYwDWAeijp+wmAFpSuPFwBQKmHjDo4AFQgATCHAC8iFXAtxg+gFxxayEACNcKxiv3phAG35TWyLSyNLSs6DDCABZ6hqgAFACUdgAK7CDAGAA8AIJQUPx4mTEQAHwlasJ0qPAwBhCo2EomJGR4lNRVcQjmLUoA0uh4dgDaXLWxXAC6BD2K+ABitHYs4VHFqDMW1fze3jqg6HYArAAMZzOMCWpoWK1x4-WN+AlAA)) - it can also help us make other parts of the `queryClient` more type-safe:

### DataTag

There's one thing about `queryClient.getQueryData` and similar functions that has always been a bit annoying in React Query: On type level, they return `unknown`. That's because React Query doesn't have an up-front, centralized definition, so when you call `queryClient.getQueryData(['todos'])`, there's no way how the library could know what type will be returned.

We are forced to help out ourselves by providing the type parameter to the function call:

```ts:title=manual-type-parameter
const todos = queryClient.getQueryData<Array<Todo>>(['todos'])
//    ^? const todos: Todo[] | undefined
```

To be clear, this isn't at all safer than just using type assertions, but at least `undefined` will be added to the union for us. If we refactor what our `fetchTodos` endpoint returns, we won't be notified here of the new type. üòî

But now that we have a function that co-locates `queryKey` and `queryFn`, we can associate the type of the `queryFn` and "tag" our `queryKey` with it. Notice what happens when we pass the `queryKey` that was created via `queryOptions` to `getQueryData`:

```ts:title=tagged-query-key
const todosQuery = queryOptions({
  queryKey: ['todos'],
  queryFn: fetchTodos,
  staleTime: 5000,
})

const todos = queryClient.getQueryData(todosQuery.queryKey)
//    ^? const todos: Todo[] | undefined
```

ü§Ø

This is pure TypeScript magic, contributed by the one and only [Mateusz Burzy≈Ñski](https://twitter.com/AndaristRake). If we look at `todosQuery.queryKey`, we can see that it's not only a string array, but it also contains information about what the `queryFn` returns:

```ts:title=dataTagSymbol
(property) queryKey: string[] & {
  [dataTagSymbol]: Todo[];
}
```

That information will then be read out by `getQueryData` (and other functions like `setQueryData`, too), to infer the type for us. This brings a whole new level of type-safety to React Query, while at the same time making it easier for us to re-use query options. A huge win in DX. üöÄ

## Query Factories

So, if you're asking me, I want to use this pattern and the `queryOptions` helper everywhere. I would even take it to a point where custom hooks won't be my first choice for abstractions. They seem a bit pointless if all they do is:

```ts:title=custom-hooks
const useTodos = () => useQuery(todosQuery)
```

There's nothing wrong with calling `useQuery` in your component directly, especially if you sometimes want to mix it with `useSuspenseQuery`. Of course, if the hook does more, like additional memoization with `useMemo`, it's still perfectly fine to add it. But I wouldn't immediately reach for it like I did before.

Additionally, I'm seeing [Query Key Factories](effective-react-query-keys) in a bit of a different light now. I've come to learn that:

<Highlight>
  Separating QueryKey from QueryFunction was a mistake
</Highlight>

The `queryKey` defines the dependencies to our `queryFn` - everything we use inside it must go into the key. So why define keys in one central place while having the functions far a way from them in our custom hooks?

However, if we <Emph>combine</Emph> the two patterns, we're getting the best of all worlds: Type-safety, co-location and great DX. üöÄ

<Aside title="Query.gg üîÆ">

This is one of the patterns I'm teaching in the new, official React Query course, which I've been working on together with [ui.dev](https://ui.dev/). The course will give you a first principles understanding of both how React Query works under the hood as well as how to write React Query code that scales. If you enjoy the content I've been creating so far, you'll love [query.gg](https://query.gg/?s=dom).

<QueryGG />

</Aside>

An example query factory could look something like this:

```ts:title=query-factory
const todoQueries = {
  all: () => ['todos'],
  lists: () => [...todoQueries.all(), 'list'],
  list: (filters: string) =>
    queryOptions({
      queryKey: [...todoQueries.lists(), filters],
      queryFn: () => fetchTodos(filters),
    }),
  details: () => [...todoQueries.all(), 'detail'],
  detail: (id: number) =>
    queryOptions({
      queryKey: [...todoQueries.details(), id],
      queryFn: () => fetchTodo(id),
      staleTime: 5000,
    }),
}
```

It contains a mix of key-only entries that we can use to build a hierarchy and for query invalidation, as well as full query objects created with the `queryOptions` helper.
